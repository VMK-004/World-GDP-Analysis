# 🌍 World Countries GDP Data Analysis

Welcome to my data science project focused on analyzing GDP per capita across 227 countries using machine learning and data visualization techniques.

This project explores how different socioeconomic factors such as population, literacy, birthrate, deathrate, and industry composition influence GDP per capita.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand global economic patterns and disparities
- Identify the impact of population, education, and geography on GDP
- Build predictive models using regression and classification algorithms

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Techniques Used

- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Each model was trained and evaluated based on performance metrics including MAE, MSE, and R².

## 📊 Visual Insights

- Heatmaps to reveal data correlation and missing values
- Regional GDP and population comparisons
- Bar plots and scatter plots for GDP trends
- Model performance visualizations

---

## 🔍 Key Findings

- Countries with higher literacy and service-oriented economies tend to have higher GDP per capita.
- Feature selection significantly improves model performance.
- Scaling has a marginal but positive effect on some models.
